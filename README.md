## About The Project

### Description

```
Burger Menu Application - Node, Express, Handlebars, Javascript, ORM, MySQL, Heroku, JawsDB, HTML, CSS.
A fun little application that allow user to "create their own custom burger" and then "scarf it"...
even "unscarf it" or "throw it away". This was mainly a practice using all of the above
listed languages, packages, libraries, techniques, and working on deploying apps with remote server setup.
```

#### User Story

```
In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and
a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query
and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
```

#### More Details

```
- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page
-- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Scarf it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger
will move to the right side of the page.

- Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
```
